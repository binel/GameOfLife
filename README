My solution to the assignment unfortunately doesn't fufill any of the extra 
   challenges, but it does meet the minimum requirements. The function
   "simulate" is where most of the action happens, as it handles determining
   the status of each cell. The functions "checkAlive" and "countNeighbors" are
   helper methods to the simulate function, which preform the action their name
   implys.
